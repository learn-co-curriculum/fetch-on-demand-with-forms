# Flatiron Software Engineering Curriculum Team

This repo serves as a source of information and tools for managing the FIS
software engineering curriculum.

You can reach us in slack at #se-curriculum-questions - we're always interested in hearing from you!

For info on the current state of the Software Engineering Curriculum, check
out [the GitHub page of this site](https://learn-co-curriculum.github.io/curriculum-team/).

## Empowerment

We want to empower the team to

* Understand our curriculum and how our curriculum systems work
* Make changes and contributions safely and confidently
* Be heard about the issues they see and experience
* Have visibility into the work that we are doing on our curriculum (and why!)

## What to do when...

### There's an urgent curriculum issue

Slack #se-curriculum-questions. Tag `@rob` and `@maxwell benton`.

### There's an urgent technical issue

Slack #product-questions.

### There's a non-urgent issue with a particular lab or lesson

Open a github issue on the canonical (learn-co-curriculum) version of the lab. If
you know how to fix the issue, feel free to make a pr.

We have tools to pull all the github issues from our active tracks daily, and we
will eventually get to your issue.

You can always reach out in #se-curriculum-questions if you aren't sure.

**EXAMPLES**:

* Confusing wording
* Typos or grammar mistakes
* Improperly formatted Markdown
* Inconsistent styling or wording between multiple lessons
* A `solution` branch that uses too-advanced concepts
* Broken NPM or RubyGems dependencies
* Tests fail on solution branch

### Feedback or questions about the software engineering curriculum

Slack #se-curriculum-questions - we want to hear everything. If you've got a longer note, feel free to share via email, write a doc, or reach out to set up a time to chat.

Old curriculum feedback tools:

* [JIRA](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/projects/CO/board)
* [Airtable](https://airtable.com/tblQBfFlNucWjWkOC/viwSC5JhL7OJRbSUD?blocks=hide)
* [Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sJJex1FsnRUoCmYDpT1HxXPjDD5skQZATHN6jPCw4Tk/edit#gid=685356823)

If it helps you to write a doc, sheet, or use some other tool to organize your thoughts, feel free.

### Something else not listed here

Feel free to reach out over slack or email - we want to hear from you!

### What we need to know in order to fix an issue

* Summary of the issue
* A link to the lesson (a link to the github repo in learn-co-curriculum is most helpful)

Nice to have:

* Github issue with description
* Pull request with a fix and description of the fix, if you have the time and know-how
* Steps to reproduce the bug
* Who is impacted, and how

## What everyone needs to know about curriculum team

* Github issues: we track these, and we will review your issues and PRs
* Looker dashboard: we track overall health and see feedback in [this dashboard](https://flatiron.looker.com/dashboards/150)
* We are few, and the work is mighty. There are 1000+ software engineering lessons and labs to maintain, and only two people maintaining them full-time. We try to be as good and as quick as we can, but we have limits!

### Communicating with us

* Slack: open discussion, raising issues, letting us know that there are prs or issues you've opened
* Github issues and prs: when there is a bug, feedback, or a fix for a particular lesson or lab

### Meetings

* **Introduction / Training**: every month, we'll introduce ourselves, teach you about our tools and processes, and give you a chance to ask any questions you have about the curriculum and how it is maintained.
* **Open Discussion and Feedback**: We meet every 3 weeks with the online software engineering team and in person software engineering team to have open discussion and feedback meetings. Look in our slack channel for the times, and if you find that you'd like to participate but can't make it, let us know, and we can try to open up more time.
* **Ad-hoc meetings**: When we want to get feedback on a particular issue, we'll schedule ad-hoc meetings to get feedback from teachers.

### Curriculum Style and Philosophy

* [Curriculum Style Guide](./writing/style_guide.md)
* [Curriculum Philosophy and Flatiron School Culture](./team/philosophy.md)

### What everyone needs to know about Learn and curriculum

_Batches_ of students get access to _tracks_ which are composed of _lessons_.

Teachers or administrators then deploy individual lessons to the batches.

We maintain the lessons, which live in the learn-co-curriculum org on github - one repo for each lesson. We also maintain the tracks - the order the lessons appear in learn.

**What curriculum is supported?** [Names and ids of tracks](./tools/names-and-ids.txt) supported by the SE curriculum team.

If you'd like to know more about how the curriculum system works, check out the [learn folder](./learn/)
